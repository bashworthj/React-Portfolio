## Description 
- My React Portfolio! I chose to go with a 'color-pencil' theme and keep the bold primary colors through out, giving it a kind of 'note pad' aesthetic. I installed react scroll to seamlessly scroll to the selected location of the page. In the future I would like to add a contact form when the 'contact' tap of the nav bar is clicked.
